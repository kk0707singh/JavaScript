        Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
        Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
        She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day.

        Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
        And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
        But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say
        When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
        'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

        And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
        'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
        Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
        Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
        She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

        Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
        If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
        So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say
        When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
        'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

        And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
        'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are

        The way you are
        The way you are

        Girl you're amazing just the way you are
        When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
        'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
        
        And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
        'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
